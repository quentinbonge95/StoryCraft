Next Steps:
On the New Host:
Transfer the backup file to your new host using scp or any file transfer method:
bash
scp storycraft_backup_20250621_104901.sql user@new_host:/path/to/StoryCraftv1/
On the new host, navigate to your project directory and start the database:
bash
cd /path/to/StoryCraftv1
docker-compose up -d db
Wait for the database to be ready (check with docker-compose ps - it should show "healthy")
Restore the database:
bash
# Copy the backup file to the container
docker cp storycraft_backup_20250621_104901.sql storycraftv1_db_1:/tmp/

# Restore the database
docker-compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d storycraft -f /tmp/storycraft_backup_20250621_104901.sql
Start all services:
bash
docker-compose up -d
Would you like me to help you with any of these steps on the new host? Or would you like me to verify the backup file's contents first?
